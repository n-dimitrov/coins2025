She is a symbol of Ireland. Her name was taken from the ancient Greek reference for Ireland and her form was realised by the sculptor John Smyth. She is viewed as a witness to the events of 1916 and, in the 100 years since, she has seen the nation blossom before her based on the ideals set out in the Proclamation. She continues to look forward and is a symbol of the past, present and future of the country. At the top of the inner circle, the inscription \u2018HIBERNIA\u2019 appears in hand\u2011rendered lettering that takes influence from the historic Book of Kells. The sunrays reflect well the underlying concept of the Rising and the Proclamation, e.g. the dawning of the new nation/republic.

Apart from its artistic line, depicting contemporary society with humour has brought Asterix a great international fame for many years. Since its inception, it has been translated into all the languages of the European Union meeting a huge success. The reputation of Asterix is for example as strong in Germany as in France.

This motif was originally part of the design proposal for the symbol of the autonomous Latvia, created by artist Ansis C\u012brulis in 1917. Later on this motif emerged as one of the basic elements of the Coat of arms of Latvia. The motif of a rising sun has also been used by artist Ansis C\u012brulis before, in the design of the Latvian riflemen\u2019s badge and his other artworks. After the foundation of the Republic of Latvia in 1918 variations of the motif of a rising sun appeared in all design proposals for the Coat of arms of the new State. The Coat of arms of Latvia was officially adopted in 1921. The design shows the motif of the rising sun, with stylised letters B and L (an abbreviation from the words \u2018Br\u012bv\u0101 Latvija\u2019 (Free Latvia)) in the centre. It also bears an inscription \u2018UZLECO\u0160\u0100 SAULE\u2019 (The rising sun), the name of the issuing country \u2018LATVIJA\u2019 and the year of issuance \u20182019\u2019.

On the occasion of the countdown to the Olympic Games, Monnaie de Paris wishes to celebrate the road to the Games. It therefore plans to issue each year 2022, 2023 and 2024 a commemorative two-euro coin with an original face celebrating the Games, through the heritage of France and Paris. The design represents the genius, a national figure and icon of French numismatics. It is depicted practicing discus throwing in an \u2018ancient\u2019 way in reference to the Olympic Games of the Antique era. His silhouette blends with the one of the Arc de Triomphe, a key element of Parisian heritage. It forms a common axis with this emblematic monument of victory. In the background, an athletics track in which the emblem of Paris 2024 is inserted on the right side, is represented. The year date, the mention RF and the mintmarks are inserted under the arch and around the foot of the Arc. The coin\u2019s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European flag.",

It is supplemented with a composition of letters A R H. P L E \u010c N I K. These letters are built into the window in exact order and can be metaphorically read as the architect\u2019s signature, which is actually exhibited in his own work. The letters are inserted into deepened window openings and can be understood (in the language of architect Ple\u010dnik) as spatial architectural interventions, as emphases, inserted into fa\u00e7ade or as geometrically designed objects. The whole composition displays an idea of space that reflects the wealth of the architect\u2019s ideas. It is centred around the main pillar, which has a role to mark the coin\u2019s space and set the ratio outside \u2013 inside or front \u2013 back, one of Ple\u010dnik\u2019s common gestures when designing space. With that, the composition becomes a spatial miniature, space within space, multi-layered and mystical. At the bottom, the inscription \u201cJO\u017dE PLE\u010cNIK\u00ab. At the left, vertically, the year \u20181872\u2019. At the right, vertically, the country of issuance \u2018SLOVENIJA\u2019 and underneath the year of issuance \u20182022\u2019.

Marko Maruli\u0107 (Marul) was born in Split in 1450 and is a prominent representative of European Christian humanism and Renaissance epics. His literary works, mostly written in Latin, are comprised of works in verse and prose, his literary models being the Bible, the Church Fathers' philosophy and classical antiquity. He wrote the epic poem Judita, his magnum opus, in Croatian. It is the first artistic epic in Croatian literature composed in the Croatian language to contain the underlying poetics of Virgil and the Biblical epics. In it, Maruli\u0107 achieved a true Renaissance synthesis of Croatian, Latin and Italian literary tradition, thus creating a masterpiece. Completed in 1501, it was first published twenty years later. The coin also features the inscriptions of the two-letter issuing country code \"HR\" (Croatia), the year of issuance \"2024.\" and the words \"MARKO MARULI\u0106\", which are all inscribed circularly along the edge of the coin's core.
