# Group Ownership API Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Coin Models** (`app/models/coin.py`)
- **`Owner` model**: Contains `owner`, `alias`, and `acquired_date` fields
- **Enhanced `Coin` model**: Added `owners` array and `is_owned` boolean
- **Proper datetime handling**: Optional timestamp for acquisition dates

### 2. **Group Coins API Endpoint** (`app/routers/coins.py`)
- **URL**: `/api/coins/group/{group_name}`
- **Returns**: Coins with complete ownership information
- **Ownership processing**: Properly handles multiple owners per coin

### 3. **Group-Aware Homepage** (`templates/index.html`)
- **Fixed Browse Catalog button**: Now group-aware (points to `/hippo/catalog` when in group mode)
- **Consistent navigation**: Maintains group context throughout the app

## 🔍 API Features

### **Ownership Information Response**
```json
{
  "coins": [
    {
      "coin_id": "CC2022GRC-A-ERA-200",
      "country": "Greece",
      "owners": [
        {
          "owner": "Drago",
          "alias": "Drago",
          "acquired_date": "2024-07-14T14:09:44Z"
        }
      ],
      "is_owned": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Ownership Filters**
- `?ownership_status=owned` - Only coins owned by group members
- `?ownership_status=missing` - Only coins NOT owned by group members  
- `?owned_by=Drago` - Only coins owned by specific user
- Standard filters (country, type, etc.) still work

### **Multiple Owners Support**
- Single coin can have multiple owners from the same group
- Owners are sorted by acquisition date (newest first)
- Each owner includes username, display alias, and acquisition timestamp

## ✅ Testing Verified

### **API Endpoints Working**
- ✅ `/api/coins/group/hippo` - Returns group coins with ownership
- ✅ Ownership filtering works correctly
- ✅ Multiple owners per coin handled properly
- ✅ Missing coins show `owners: []` and `is_owned: false`

### **Frontend Integration**
- ✅ Group homepage shows group indicator badge
- ✅ Browse Catalog button respects group context
- ✅ Navigation maintains group state

### **Error Handling**
- ✅ Non-existent groups return 404
- ✅ Proper validation and error messages
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Get all coins for a group**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/coins/group/hippo?limit=10"
```

### **Get only owned coins**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/coins/group/hippo?ownership_status=owned"
```

### **Get coins owned by specific user**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/coins/group/hippo?owned_by=Drago"
```

### **Get missing German coins**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/coins/group/hippo?country=Germany&ownership_status=missing"
```

## 🎉 Result

The group ownership functionality is now **fully implemented and working**:

1. **Backend**: Complete ownership tracking with BigQuery integration
2. **API**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive filtering
3. **Frontend**: Group-aware navigation and user interface
4. **Data Model**: Proper ownership representation with timestamps

Users can now see exactly who owns which coins in their collecting group! 🪙👥
