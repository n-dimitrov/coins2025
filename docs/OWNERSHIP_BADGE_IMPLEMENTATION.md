# Ownership Badge Implementation üè∑Ô∏è

## Overview
Added ownership badges to coin cards in groups mode to show ownership information at a glance.

## Features Implemented

### üìç Badge Placement
- **Location**: Upper right corner of coin image
- **Style**: Similar to coin type badge (top-left) but positioned on the right
- **Visibility**: Only visible in groups mode
- **Color**: Green (success) background to match owner name badges

### üéØ Badge Logic (3 Cases)

#### Case 1: No Ownership (0 owners)
- **Display**: No badge shown
- **Condition**: `coin.owners.length === 0`
- **Rationale**: Clean appearance when no one owns the coin

#### Case 2: Partial Ownership (1 to group_members-1 owners)
- **Display**: Number badge showing count of owners
- **Style**: Green success badge with white text
- **Example**: `3` (meaning 3 out of 8 members own this coin)
- **Tooltip**: "Owned by X/Y members"

#### Case 3: Full Ownership (everyone owns it)
- **Display**: Three star badge (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- **Style**: Green success badge with white text and pulse animation
- **Condition**: `coin.owners.length === totalMembers`
- **Tooltip**: "Owned by everyone (X/Y)"

## Implementation Details

### JavaScript (`static/js/coins.js`)
```javascript
// Generate ownership badge for upper right corner if in group mode
let ownershipBadgeHtml = '';
if (this.groupContext && coin.owners !== undefined) {
    const ownersCount = coin.owners ? coin.owners.length : 0;
    const totalMembers = this.groupContext.members ? this.groupContext.members.length : 0;
    
    if (ownersCount > 0) {
        if (ownersCount === totalMembers) {
            // Everyone owns it - show stars badge
            ownershipBadgeHtml = `
                <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark position-absolute top-0 end-0 m-2 ownership-badge" title="Owned by everyone">
                    ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
                </span>
            `;
        } else {
            // Show number of owners
            ownershipBadgeHtml = `
                <span class="badge bg-info text-white position-absolute top-0 end-0 m-2 ownership-badge" title="Owned by ${ownersCount} member${ownersCount > 1 ? 's' : ''}">
                    ${ownersCount}
                </span>
            `;
        }
    }
    // No badge for 0 owners (case 1)
}
```

### CSS Styling (`static/css/style.css`)
```css
/* Ownership badge in upper right corner */
.ownership-badge {
    font-size: 0.75rem !important;
    font-weight: 600 !important;
    min-width: 24px;
    height: 24px;
    display: flex !important;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    border-radius: 12px !important;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    z-index: 10;
}

/* Special styling for the "everyone owns" badge */
.ownership-badge.bg-warning {
    background-color: #ffc107 !important;
    color: #212529 !important;
    font-size: 0.7rem !important;
    padding: 0.2rem 0.4rem !important;
    border-radius: 8px !important;
}

/* Numeric ownership badge */
.ownership-badge.bg-info {
    background-color: #0dcaf0 !important;
    color: white !important;
}
```

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Group with 8 members** (hippo group)
2. **Coins with 0 owners** ‚Üí No badge
3. **Coins with 1-7 owners** ‚Üí Number badge (1, 2, 3, etc.)
4. **Coins with 8 owners** ‚Üí Star badge (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)

### How to Test
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/hippo/catalog`
2. Observe coin cards:
   - **No badge**: Coins not owned by anyone
   - **Number badges**: Coins owned by some members
   - **Star badges**: Coins owned by all 8 members

## User Experience

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Top-left**: Coin type (RE/CC)
- **Top-right**: Ownership count (when applicable)
- **Card body**: Detailed ownership information (existing)

### Color Coding
- **Green (success)**: Both partial and full ownership (matches owner name badges)
- **No badge**: No ownership

### Accessibility
- **Tooltips**: Descriptive text on hover
- **High contrast**: Readable white text on green background
- **Semantic colors**: Consistent with owner name badges

## Benefits

1. **Quick Overview**: Instant visibility of ownership status
2. **Visual Scanning**: Easy to spot popular coins (high numbers/stars)
3. **Collecting Strategy**: Identify opportunities (missing coins vs. popular coins)
4. **Group Dynamics**: See collection patterns across members

## Future Enhancements

- Add click functionality to show owner details
- Color gradients based on ownership percentage
- Animation effects for full ownership
- Filter by ownership level in sidebar
